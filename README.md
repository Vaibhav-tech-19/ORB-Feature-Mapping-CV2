ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is a feature detection and descriptor extraction algorithm used in computer vision and image processing. It was developed to address the limitations of existing feature detection methods, such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), by providing a fast and efficient alternative.

# Streamlit ORB Feature Mapping WebApp

## Overview
This Streamlit web application allows users to upload an image and apply the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature mapping algorithm for keypoint detection and visualization.

## Features
- **File Uploader:** Users can upload images in jpg, png, or jpeg formats.
- **ORB Feature Mapping:** The application utilizes the ORB algorithm to detect keypoints in the uploaded image and overlays them with green points. The result is displayed alongside the original image.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy
